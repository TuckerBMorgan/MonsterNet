A personal project to learn Autoencoders

I am interested in the use of Neural Networks to generate new things from an exsisting style
I choose the Pokemon images because they were all the same sizes, and yet still had a distinct style and I could find a good number of them


requirements:
	pip install tensorflow
	pip install bokeh

run with
	bokeh serve --show ./bokeh_server.py

Then adjust the weights and click the Generate Pokemon button to see what changes you have made
